## Background
This project is inspired by the book "Make friends with time" by Li Xiaolai.
In the book, the author Xiaolai mentioned the idea of keeping a time-event log
to keep track of your day to day life so that you know what time is contribute
to accomplish what goal.

I have tried this idea on a journal in paper and find it useful in the sense that
I have more awareness on where I put my time. It is almost like keeping a ledger for
saving money. This is for saving time.

The motivation to write this app instead of keep using the paper journal is to solve
one painpoint. The painpoint is when I do a summary each month to see what I have done
and where I spend my time. It take quite a while, whereas if I record the logs digitally,
I can do all kinds of sorting and summarizing I want. Hence, I am write this app to make
my life easier:)

## Technical Stack
Technically, this is to explore the possibility of Hybrid apps. I did a hybrid app back in
University about two years ago. Back then, the hybrid app technology is not mature yet.
Mainly because the support for native features are not as smooth as native app. But it
does not mean the idea of write once, running everywhere is not good. Moreover, I just
finished a Angular project and is more familier with JS than any native mobile language.
This project is mainly to carry out an idea, not to learn a new programming language.

Therefore, after some research, the decision to use **Monaca CLI** and **Onsen UI** with
**Angular2** is made.
